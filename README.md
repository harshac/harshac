## Hi there 👋

I’m Harsha — a polyglot technologist with 12+ years of experience building scalable platforms, leading full-stack teams, and shipping real-world products across EdTech, finance, and beyond.

- 🛠️ I architect systems that evolve with the business — not just support it.
- 📦 Passionate about extreme programming, clean code, and AI that’s actually useful.
- 🤝 I care deeply about team culture, mentoring engineers, and building inclusive environments.

Currently leading engineering at Boclips, building the next generation of learning tools.
Ex-Pivotal, ThoughtWorks.
